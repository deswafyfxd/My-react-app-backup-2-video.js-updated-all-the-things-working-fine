Yes, exactly! When Rclone serves files over HTTP, it creates URLs for each file. You can:

1. **Browse Files**: Open the URL in a web browser to navigate and browse the files.
2. **Stream Media**: Copy the file's URL and paste it into a media player like VLC to stream the video or audio directly.

This setup gives you flexible access to your cloud-stored files and makes streaming a breeze. Quite handy, right? ðŸš€


Yes, it's possible! Integrating a media player directly into your webpage allows users to stream audio and video files served by Rclone seamlessly. You can use HTML5 `<audio>` and `<video>` tags or a JavaScript library like Video.js to achieve this. It makes the user experience more streamlined, enabling direct playback on the webpage without needing to copy URLs into an external player. A pretty cool idea! ðŸš€
