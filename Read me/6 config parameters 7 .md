Sure! In Render, your Rclone serve command will start an HTTP server. The example URL you provided is for your static site, but your served files will be on a different port.

### Example:
If your Rclone serve command is running and serving files from `myremote:/path/to/folder`, and itâ€™s using the default HTTP port 8080, you would access it like this:

**Example URL for Rclone Serve**:
```plaintext
http://your-backend-service-url:8080/path/to/folder
```

### How to Get Your Backend Service URL:
1. **Go to Render Dashboard**.
2. **Select Your Backend Service**.
3. **Check the URL Assigned by Render** (e.g., `https://your-backend-service.onrender.com`).

### Full Example:
Assume your backend URL is `https://my-backend-service.onrender.com`:
```plaintext
http://my-backend-service.onrender.com:8080/path/to/folder
```

This URL allows you to access and stream files served by Rclone directly from your cloud storage. Exciting, right? Ready to try it out? ðŸš€
