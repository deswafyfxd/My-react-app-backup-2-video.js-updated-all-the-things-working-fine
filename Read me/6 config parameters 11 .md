Constantly restarting the deployment due to environment variables can be a pain. You can handle this by executing Rclone commands outside of the start-up script or using task scheduling. Here are a couple of ways to manage this:

### 1. Scheduled Jobs
Use tools like `cron` to schedule Rclone commands instead of running them at startup.

**Steps**:
1. **Install Cron**: Ensure cron is available in your Render environment.
2. **Create Cron Job**: Edit the crontab to schedule your Rclone commands.

**Example Cron Job**:
```bash
# Open crontab for editing
crontab -e

# Add a new cron job (e.g., run every hour)
0 * * * * /path/to/rclone sync myremote:/source /local/destination
```

### 2. Background Processes
Run Rclone commands as background processes to avoid blocking the main app.

**Example Command**:
```bash
rclone sync myremote:/source /local/destination &
```

This runs the command in the background, allowing the main app to continue running without interruption.

### 3. Use Supervisor
Use a process control system like Supervisor to manage Rclone commands separately.

**Steps**:
1. **Install Supervisor**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install supervisor
   ```

2. **Create Supervisor Configuration**:
   ```ini
   [program:rclone_sync]
   command=rclone sync myremote:/source /local/destination
   autostart=true
   autorestart=true
   ```

This setup ensures your Rclone commands run separately from your main application, avoiding unnecessary restarts. These methods should help streamline your workflow on Render. Sound good? ðŸš€
