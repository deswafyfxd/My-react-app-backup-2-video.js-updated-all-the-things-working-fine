### Serve Remote Storage
Rclone can serve files over HTTP, FTP, or WebDAV. This is handy for streaming media or accessing files remotely.

### Steps to Serve Remote Storage:
1. **Remote Configuration**: Configure Rclone with your remote storage (as we did earlier).
2. **Specify Remote**: Provide the remote path you want to serve (e.g., `myremote:/path/to/folder`).
3. **Serve Command**: Clicking the "Serve" button will trigger Rclone to serve that path over HTTP.

### Example:
**Remote for Serve**: `myremote:/path/to/folder`
- **Action**: Click "Serve"

### What Happens Next:
- Rclone starts an HTTP server at a specified port (default: 8080).
- You can access the files by navigating to `http://yourdomain:8080/path/to/folder`.
- Great for streaming videos or accessing files directly from your browser or media player.

This method allows seamless access to your cloud storage files over HTTP, making it simple to stream or share content. Handy, right? ðŸš€
