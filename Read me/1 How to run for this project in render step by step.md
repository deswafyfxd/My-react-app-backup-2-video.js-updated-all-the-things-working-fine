Alright, hereâ€™s a clear, step-by-step guide for running your project on Render, both the back-end and front-end:

### Back-End (Flask + Discord Bot) on Render

1. **Set Up a Repository**:
   - Make sure you have all your back-end files (`app.py`, `flask_app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `accounts.yml`) in a GitHub repository.

2. **Create a New Web Service**:
   - Go to your Render dashboard.
   - Click on "New" and select "Web Service".
   - Connect your GitHub repository containing the back-end code.
   - Choose your repository and branch.

3. **Configure Build and Start Commands**:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn flask_app:app`
   
   These commands ensure Render installs all dependencies and starts your Flask app using Gunicorn.

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Add your Discord token as an environment variable.
   - Key: `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   - Value: `your_discord_token_here`

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Create Web Service".
   - Render will pull your code, install dependencies, and start the service.

### Front-End (React) on Render

1. **Set Up Your React App**:
   - Make sure your React app (`outlook-management-ui`) is in the same GitHub repository or in a separate one.
   - Ensure the folder structure is correct, with `src/components/AccountForm.js` and the updated `App.js` and `package.json`.

2. **Create a New Static Site**:
   - Go to your Render dashboard.
   - Click on "New" and select "Static Site".
   - Connect your GitHub repository containing the React app.
   - Choose your repository and branch.

3. **Configure Build and Publish Directories**:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `build`
   
   These commands ensure Render installs all dependencies, builds the React app, and serves static files from the `build` directory.

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Create Static Site".
   - Render will pull your code, install dependencies, build the app, and deploy it.

### Final Checks

- Ensure your back-end service URL matches the proxy setting in your React appâ€™s `package.json`.
- Visit the URLs provided by Render for your deployed services to ensure everything is working.

This should get both your back-end and front-end up and running on Render. Let me know how it goes, or if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
