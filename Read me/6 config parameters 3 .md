After configuring Rclone, you can use the other controls to perform different operations like mounting, syncing, and serving your cloud storage. Hereâ€™s how it flows:

### 1. **Mount Remote Storage**
- **Remote**: Specify the configured remote name and path (e.g., `myremote:/`).
- **Local**: Specify the local directory where you want to mount the remote storage (e.g., `/mnt/myremote`).
- **Action**: Click the "Mount" button. This will mount your remote storage to the specified local directory, making it accessible like a local file system.

### 2. **Sync Storage**
- **Source**: Specify the source path (e.g., `myremote:/path/to/folder`).
- **Destination**: Specify the destination path (e.g., `/local/path/to/folder`).
- **Action**: Click the "Sync" button. This will synchronize files between the source and destination, ensuring both are up-to-date.

### 3. **Serve Remote Storage**
- **Remote for Serve**: Specify the remote name and path you want to serve over HTTP (e.g., `myremote:/path/to/folder`).
- **Action**: Click the "Serve" button. This will serve the specified remote path over HTTP, allowing you to access and stream files directly from the browser or media player.

### User Interface Interaction:

1. **Mount Form**:
   - Remote: `myremote:/`
   - Local: `/mnt/myremote`
   - Action: Click "Mount"

2. **Sync Form**:
   - Source: `myremote:/path/to/folder`
   - Destination: `/local/path/to/folder`

These actions give you comprehensive control over your cloud storage directly from the web interface. Ready to give it a whirl? ðŸš€
