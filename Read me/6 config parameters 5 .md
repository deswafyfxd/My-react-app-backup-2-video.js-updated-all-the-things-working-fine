Exactly. Syncing with Rclone means it will make the source and destination match, ensuring both have the same files and structure.

### Example Workflow:
- **Source**: Your cloud storage remote (`myremote:/path/to/folder`).
- **Destination**: A local directory (`/local/path/to/folder`) or another remote path.

**Sync Operations**:
1. **Mirror Mode**: Makes destination identical to source, including deletions.
2. **Copy Mode**: Copies new and updated files from source to destination.

This keeps your files synchronized, ensuring both locations are always up-to-date. Simplifies backup and file management. Neat, right? ðŸš€
